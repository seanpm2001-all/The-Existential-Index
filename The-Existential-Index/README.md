# Contributing and distributing

The Existential Index is a public book project regarding Existentialism and related mentalities. It is designed to be an index and glossary of terms related to Existentialism and Nihilism, and to provide examples of it in everyday life. It is also designed to help people cope with it and try to fix their mindset if the negativity upsets them. Anyone who has knowledge on the subject or wants to improve the document (and who has the skill) is allowed to, as long as the rules of this projects `CONTRIBUTING.md` file are followed.

This book is distributed in 2 major formats

## Binary

[See Binary releases here](/The-Existential-Index/Binaries/)

The binary format of this book is pre-compiled, and written in the ODT format. There will be no default distribution in the DOC, DOCX, UOT, DOT, DOTX, PDF, EPUB, DJVU, TXT, OTT, DOCM, FODT, or RTF/etc. formats, although third party support will be available. I might change this rule in the future.

This format is designed for the everyday computer user, and the binary programmer. It is going to be distributed in as many languages as possible, although at the moment, English is the most prevalent language.

## Source code

[See Source Code releases here](/The-Existential-Index/SourceCode/)

Intermediate/Advanced computer users who use LaTeX or other software compilation methods have a version just for them, the LaTeX (TeX) version is a simplified port of the binary version designed to work with LaTeX, and needs to be compiled first. There are benefits to this method, but it isn't recommended for average/beginner computer users.
